<h1>Experiment</h1>

<h2>This is an application for conducting computational experiments related to the running time of various algorithms for calculating combinatorial numbers, such as Fibonacci numbers and harmonic numbers. 

It was created in order to study the time anomalies of the algorithms mentioned above.

All algorithms are run in pure Python, creating a separate process that is assigned the highest priority. The running time results are returned in nanoseconds.</h2>

-----------------
How to use it?
-----------------
First of all in your Terminal:

- [x]  Navigate to the location where you want the repository to be copied, using the cd command
- [x]  Clone Experiment on your computer: `git clone https://github.com/ixslea/Experiment.git`
- [x]  Navigate to the Experiment folder: `cd Experiment`
- [x]  Install the necessary packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [x]  Run Experiment: `python Experiment.py`
-----------------

1. Choose 'Fibonacci' or 'Harmonic' on button above.

2. Then choose one of the given algorithms to run.

3. Enter number of steps and then number of runs (from 0 to 100) by keyboard or slider.

4. Do not forget to press the buttons to submit the numbers you entered!

5. If you want to get graphs of the average running time of the algorithms, check the "Show graphs" box.

6. Press 'Run' button.
-----------------

<h2>After calculation all results would be saved in file "experiment_log_info.log" in folder 'Experiment'.
        
IF YOU WANT TO USE IT LATER DO NOT FORGET TO RENAME IT!

Otherwise, after clicking the 'Run' button, all the results would be overwritten.</h2>
